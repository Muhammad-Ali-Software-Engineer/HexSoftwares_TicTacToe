## Description
This is a **Player vs Computer Tic-Tac-Toe game** built in Python as part of my internship at **Hex Softwares Pvt. Ltd.**.  
The game allows a user to play against a computer in the classic Tic-Tac-Toe format. It includes input validation, win/draw detection, and a replay option.  

This project demonstrates practical Python skills such as lists, loops, conditionals, functions, and basic game logic.

## Features
- Player vs Computer gameplay  
- Input validation (only numbers 1–9 allowed)  
- Win detection for both player and computer  
- Draw detection
